The application welcomes the user to the game. The application recognizes the user\textquotesingle{}s speech input and starts the game when the user says \char`\"{}blackjack\char`\"{}. Other speech is regarded as invalid.

Initializes the user\textquotesingle{}s bet for the game

The game will be run as long as the user\textquotesingle{}s voice input is \char`\"{}yes\char`\"{}, signaling they would like to keep playing

The game is run via the rungame method of the table class

When the user has played through, they are given the option to play again

When the user decides to stop playing (i.\+e. does not say \char`\"{}yes\char`\"{} when asked to keep playing), the application says via voice output that the application has ended.
